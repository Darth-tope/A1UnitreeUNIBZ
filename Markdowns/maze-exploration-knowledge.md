# ROS Maze Exploration and Solving Knowledge Transfer

## Current System Setup
- Robot: Unitree A1 quadruped
- SLAM System: Using slamware_ros_sdk
- Navigation: move_base with TrajectoryPlannerROS
- Current Parameters:
```yaml
TrajectoryPlannerROS:
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.15
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.15
  latch_xy_goal_tolerance: true
  pdist_scale: 0.6
  gdist_scale: 0.8
```

## Approach 1: Frontier-Based Exploration
### Description
- Robot identifies boundaries between known and unknown space ("frontiers")
- Moves to closest frontier to explore new areas
- Good for complete maze exploration

### Implementation Requirements
```python
# Key topics needed:
- /map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid) # Current map
- /scan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan)  # LIDAR data
- /move_base_simple/goal        # Send exploration goals
```

### Advantages
- Systematic exploration
- Good map coverage
- Works well with unknown environments

### Disadvantages
- Might not be most efficient for goal-reaching
- Can spend time exploring unnecessary areas

## Approach 2: Goal-Oriented Exploration
### Description
- Combines exploration with pathfinding to goal
- Prioritizes paths that might lead to goal
- Uses D* Lite or similar algorithms

### Implementation Requirements
```python
# Additional topics needed:
- /slam_planner_node/global_costmap/costmap
- /slam_planner_node/TrajectoryPlannerROS/global_plan
```

### Advantages
- More efficient for reaching goal
- Balances exploration and goal-seeking

### Disadvantages
- Might miss some maze areas
- More complex implementation

## Approach 3: Wall Following with Memory
### Description
- Modified right/left-hand rule algorithm
- Maintains memory of visited paths
- Uses LIDAR for wall detection

### Implementation Requirements
```python
# Key components:
- Wall detection using LIDAR
- Path memory system
- Backtracking capability
```

### Advantages
- Simple to implement
- Guaranteed to solve many maze types
- Works well in structured environments

### Disadvantages
- Not always optimal
- Might not work for all maze types

## Approach 4: Hybrid A* with Dynamic Replanning
### Description
- Combines A* pathfinding with real-time mapping
- Replans when new obstacles discovered
- Uses heuristic to guide exploration

### Implementation Requirements
```python
# Components needed:
- Custom path planner
- Integration with move_base
- Dynamic goal adjustment
```

### Advantages
- Efficient pathfinding
- Adapts to new information
- Good balance of exploration and goal-seeking

### Disadvantages
- Computationally intensive
- Complex implementation

## Implementation Considerations

### Common Requirements
1. Map Processing
```python
def process_map(occupancy_grid):
    # Convert OccupancyGrid to numpy array
    # Identify free/occupied/unknown spaces
    pass
```

2. Goal Management
```python
def set_exploration_goal(point):
    # Create and publish goal
    goal = PoseStamped()
    goal.header.frame_id = "map"
    goal.pose.position = point
    goal_pub.publish(goal)
```

3. Safety Checks
```python
def check_safety(scan_data):
    # Process LIDAR data
    # Ensure safe movement
    pass
```

### Key ROS Topics to Monitor
```python
# Publishers
'/move_base_simple/goal'
'/cmd_vel'

# Subscribers
'/map'
'/scan'
'/slam_planner_node/global_costmap/costmap'
```

### Visualization Options
1. Path Planning:
   - Show considered paths
   - Highlight chosen route
   - Mark explored areas

2. Decision Making:
   - Display frontiers
   - Show cost calculations
   - Indicate current strategy

## Next Steps

1. Choose approach based on:
   - Maze complexity
   - Performance requirements
   - Implementation time constraints

2. Implementation phases:
   - Basic movement and safety
   - Core algorithm implementation
   - Testing and refinement
   - Visualization and debugging

3. Testing scenarios:
   - Simple corridors
   - Dead ends
   - Multiple path options
   - Complete maze navigation

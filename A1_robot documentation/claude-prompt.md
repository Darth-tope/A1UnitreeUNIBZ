I'm debugging a Unitree A1 robot system where:

System Architecture:
- All processes run on robot (192.168.123.10)
- Accessed via SSH from development machine (192.168.123.254)
- Uses UDP ports 8080 (client) and 8007 (server)
- Network gateway changed from 192.168.123.1 to 192.168.123.2

Component Stack:
1. ROS Core
2. LCM Bridge (initializes UDP)
3. Walk LCM Controller
4. Robot Control System

Current Status:
- SSH connection working
- Network reconfigured to use new gateway
- SDK v3.2 installed
- Build system modified for ARM64
- UDP communication issues resolved
- Subscriber tracking added

Recent Changes:
1. Network Configuration:
- Gateway changed to 192.168.123.2
- DNS servers set to 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

2. Code Modifications:
- Added subscriber tracking
- Enhanced debug printing
- Fixed UDP state reporting

3. Build System:
- Updated for ARM64 architecture
- Fixed library dependencies

Need assistance with:
1. UDP communication verification
2. Subscriber tracking enhancement
3. Network stability monitoring
4. Performance optimization

Testing shows UDP communication established but needs verification of complete message chain from ROS through LCM to robot control.
